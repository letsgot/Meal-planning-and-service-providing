Adding Plans to your backend :(skeleteon code)
We are using mvc architecture
api level -> main sub-route with your router
create a planRouter -> remaining route & associating controller fns
create controller functions ->
get,update,delete,
create getall
create model -> db schema
you first fill your model -> controller -> router
Usage : send data to a particular and following your schema
Plans Schema : name,duration,price:discount
All Plans Page creation
deployment

Bought plan + integration razorpay-> fall back route
HomePage completion
Deployment
Backend: (Heroku)
Implement cors : package cors
convert your code to work with both process.env and secrets.js
put process.env.[private data key ] || require("../secrets)[private data]
Remove static port number : process.env.PORT || 3000
rewrite start script in package.json -> scripts:{"start":"node api.js"}
push the code to github
heroku
-> signup -> create new app
set Env variables
go to setting -> click on reveal config vars
enter all the secret key value pair
-> go to deploy
-> Connect to a github repo -> enable automatic deploy->deploy branch
Frontend : netlify
code : add full links when making api request to backend
Netlify : * signup -> click on add new site -> import an existing project * authorize github -> choose your repo
deploy : warnings are converted to errors to prevent that * in next popup -> in build command put : CI=false npm run build
Issues
Home Page,PlanDetails,reviews,Bookings : Dynamic version,
Config data hiding
Security : Theory : integrate
Presisting Login -> JWT and maybe will be local storage
